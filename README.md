# BridgehaCS
[BridghaCS website](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bridgehacs "Title").. Previously built on Openshift using Angular.

Trying to help form a strong developer atmosphere in Boston, because even though there's a large development group, it's not really connected that well.  Doing my part as a programmer and trying to connect students from around the area with each other!

Site taken down, but to run locally:

- Clone repo onto local device.
- Navigate to BridgehaCS directory on terminal.
- Install development dependencies with `npm install`
- Start server with `npm start`
- Site should be visible on localhost:3000
