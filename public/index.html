            <h2>What's bridgehaCS?</h2>
            <p>Hosted by and for developers,</p>

            <p>BridgehaCS is a 36 hour period where developers, designers, and thinkers alike can get together to <span style="color:#F2B51F;"> build something totally awesome.</span> Like most hackathons, we'll have prizes for multiple categories, but the limit to what entries can be is broad. We don't want you to be afraid to come to this hackathon with just an idea.  <span style="color:#F2B51F;"> Don't know how to code? No problem</span>, we'll find a team that wants to help you build your vision into reality.</p>
         <h2>Who can come?</h2>
         <p> The creators of this hackathon are two software engineering interns this summer.  We hope that we find people in similar situations drawn to our event, but are keeping the hackathon <span style="color:#F2B51F;"> open to anyone</span>, on a case by case basis.</p>
         <h2>Cool. Can I sign up?</h2>
         <p> Yes, but first we need to make sure that we have enough people who are interested. We'll be honest, we aren't a typical hackathon in that we have no backers to start. BridgehaCS is reaching out to companies within the area, but we need interest to get their full attention.  That's why it's <span style="color:#F2B51F;"> really important that you fill out the form as soon as you can </span>, so that we can get a great hackathon underway as soon as possible!</p>
